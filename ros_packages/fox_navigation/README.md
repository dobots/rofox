Initial tuning of costmap paramaters done. The setup of the move_base node and config files is initially copied from husarion fox_navigation package inside the fox_description repo. 

ToDo:
- Further tuning of the costmap parameters
- Compare move_base node and config files with files inside tb3_navigation package inside ros_summerschool repo. This package uses a different local planner (teb_local_planner). Maybe there is a difference in performance.
